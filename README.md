Hello and thank you for visiting my Github page
Since quite some time ago I've been wanting to share my experience on my journey on Python Programming, Data Analytics and AI.
Two years ago, I discovered this new and exciting field and it captivated me since the very beginning, but I didn't know much about programming, statistics or data at all. 
After two years working hard and learning this craft I’ve recently started sharing with newcomers my experience, knowledge and mistakes I’ve made along the way. 
On this repository you'll find the different notes I’ve elaborated on Python Programming, data analysis and Ai that I’ve often use to teach those who reach out to me. 

The repository will be organized on three folders: 
PythonBasics, which will teach you the very basic of python programming.
DataAnalisys, which will teach you to analyze data based on basic statistics, the Numpy Libraries and the Pandas Libraries
MachineLearing, which will teach you the science and math behind MachineLearning and DeepLearning
