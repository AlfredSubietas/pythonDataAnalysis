    "Let's analyse what this definition means: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Interpreted__: An interpreted language is a programming language that execute instructions directly without the need of previously compiling. The program translates directly each statement from a human-readable language to machine code. On the contrary, a compiling language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no pre-runtime translation takes place).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - __High-level__: A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language, which uses commands close to processos instructions. The word \"low\" refers to the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes described as being \"close to the hardware\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - __General-purpose__: In computer software, a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains (a general-purpose language). A general-purpose programming language has this status because it does not include language constructs designed to be used within a specific application domain. Conversely, a domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within a specific application domain. Examples include page description languages and database query languages (eg: SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Programming Language__ : a set of rules, words, etc. that are used for writing computer programs. A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.\n",
