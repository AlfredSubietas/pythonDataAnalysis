The opposite of a fruitful function is void function — one that is not executed for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful.

Even though void functions are not executed for their resulting value, Python always wants to return something. So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value None.\n",
